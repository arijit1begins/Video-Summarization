<h4>Reading and Writing Images :</h4>
<h5>Using OpenCV functions : <em>imread(src, conversion)</em> -> src is the name of the image and conversion can be 0 for grayscale and 1 for coloured images. One can also use OpenCV constants as cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE for grayscale and cv2.IMREAD_COLOR for coloured(without any alpha factor) and cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED for loading the alpha factor(transparency). </h5>
